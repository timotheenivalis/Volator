# Volator

Individual-based simulations software inspired by the life-cycle of the snow vole (Chionomys nivalis). It models the genetics of quantitative traits, selection, demography...
I used it to obtain theoretical expectations about the relationship between the dynamics of selection and evolution.
I am also using it to study the coupling between population dynamics and evolution, and questions related to evolutionary rescue.

More in general, Volator is a very fast way to get many voles. I think that's great.

Still, I am not sure many people need voles at the moment, so I am not putting too much effort into this repository for now. Message me if you want more information.
